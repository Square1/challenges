This month we will get hands on with **[MIT Open Courseware]** and tackle an assignment from **6.00SC**.
At the end of the Code Co-Op session we'll share solutions to help each other learn.

Solve this problem in **any language** of your choosing.

_(MIT students received this assignment on their second sessions in the course.)_
