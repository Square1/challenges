# Design Week Special: Pattern Hunt

## Challenge

### Goal
**Hunt down 9 design patterns** from the original _Gang of Four Design Patterns_ from repositories on Github.

0. **TEAM UP!** No lone-wolves allowed
1. Find a public project hosted on GitHub
2. Locate an applied _design pattern_
3. Make a note of where you found it (to present later)

At the end you will present your group's discoveries to everyone; explaining the design pattern and it's implementation step-by-step.
The group will :+1: or :-1: on the following criteria:
- Did you explain the pattern correctly?
- Did you identify the pattern correctly?


### Scoring

:+1: = +5 points

:-1: = +1 point
